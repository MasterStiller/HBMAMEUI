A new direction for HBMAME: Games that are added to MAME will no longer be removed
from HBMAME. If it's a homebrew, it's in HBMAME forever. Also, test roms and other
non-revenue sets will be added in when they are found. Games such as Pauline Edition
and Lost Cave have been added back, the search continues for others.
